# Routes

viewing newly developed components can be done by modifying App.tsx:

```typescript
{/* DEV ROUTES BEGIN*/}
// Test view by itself on localhost:3000/dev/custom_component
<Route path="/dev/custom_component">
   <CustomComponent />
</Route>
// Test view inside Dashboard on localhost:3000/dev/dashboard/custom_component
<Route path="/dev/dashboard/custom_component">
   <Dashboard>
       <CustomComponent />
   </Dashboard>
</Route>
{/* DEV ROUTES END */}
```

developing authenticated routes requires mysql database set up in dev environment. Autheticated routes are marked in App.tsx with `route` in `Routes` array coming from `Routes.tsx`:

```typescript
{
    /* AUTHENTICATED ROUTES BEGIN*/
}
{
    Routes.map((route, idx) => (
        <AuthGuard
            path={route.path}
            redirect="/"
            authRedirect="/dashboard/home"
            key={idx}
            account_type={route.account_type}
        >
            <Dashboard>
                <route.content />
            </Dashboard>
        </AuthGuard>
    ));
}
{
    /* AUTHENTICATED ROUTES END*/
}
```

# Pages

## Dashboard (complete)

`Dashboard.tsx` serves as a container for all authenticated users (customer, manager, owner) that renders the current "view".

For example, a customer logged in will see links to components in the `views/customer` and `views/shared` directories on the Dashboard navigation drawer. Clicking the link 'Docks' will then render `views/customer/Docks.tsx` inside `pages/Dashboard.tsx`:

```typescript
{
<Dashboard>
    <Docks>
</Dashboard>
}
```

Currently links on `NavDrawer.tsx` are hard coded to display customer views only. Will be refactored in future to display correct links for manager and owner.

## Landing (complete)

Landing home page for users not signed in. Provides links to sign-in and sign-up.

## SignIn (complete)

Sign-in page that allows customers/managers/owner to sign in to website.

## SignUp (needs final testing & cleanup)

Sign-up page that allows customers to sign-up to website.

# Views

Naming and functionality of each view are subject to change. Current state of views are detailed below:

## Shared

### Home (complete)

View rendered when customer, manager, or owner first logs-in. Displays Summary for customer redirects to Reports for owner and VerifyPurchase for manager.

### Account (not implemented, deprecated)

View that allows customer, manager, or owner to edit account information. Low priority on implementing

## Customer

### Rent (complete)

View that shows docks and allows customer to rent bike

### Return (complete)

View that shows bikes currently rented by customer and allows customer to return rented bikes

### Transaction (complete)

View that shows customer transaction history

## Manager

### VerifyPurchases (implemented, needs final testing)

View that allows manager to add fees of completed transactions in the last hour

## Owner

### PriceControl (not implemented, deprecated)

View that allows owner to set prices at docks

### Management (not implemented, deprecated)

View that allows owner to create/delete manager accounts

### Reports (complete)
